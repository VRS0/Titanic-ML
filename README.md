# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction 

This is a **learning-focused project** where I explored the classic Titanic dataset, performed a mini EDA, preprocessed the data, and trained multiple ML models to predict passenger survival.

## 📌 Project Overview  
The main goal of this project was to **learn the end-to-end ML pipeline** – from data exploration to model evaluation – using a well-known dataset.  

**Steps I followed:**  
1. **Mini EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
   - Checked basic statistics & distributions  
   - Explored correlations between features  
   - Visualized survival counts  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Removed unnecessary columns (like PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin)  
   - Filled missing `Age` values using **Median Imputation**  
   - Encoded categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`) using **Label Encoding**  
   - Scaled numerical features with **Min-Max Scaling**  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Split data into train/test using `train_test_split`  
   - Trained multiple models:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Decision Tree  
     - Random Forest  
     - KNN  
     - SVM  
     - Naive Bayes  
   - **Random Forest** gave the best overall score 🎯
